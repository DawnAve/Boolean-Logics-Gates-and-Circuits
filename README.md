# Boolean-Logics-Gates-and-Circuits

Here is a C project, building logic gates and circuits. 
There are four parts in this project, which is an implementation of the logic graph as in the file, parts a b, and c. The last part is to transform logic in truth table form into code form. 
Part of the code is from:

The basic idea here is to create a circuit with gates, and gates with boolean logic. 
* Not all parts of the solution is optimized, they can run correctly, but not always the most efficiently.
